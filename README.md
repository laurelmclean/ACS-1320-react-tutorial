## User Stories

1. As a person who recently moved to San Francisco, I want to be able to discover random new public spaces, so I can become more familiar with and enjoy my new hometown.
2. I have an out of town guest coming to visit me next week, and there are several public spaces we are planning to visit and would like to view details about them, so we can be sure to arrive during hours that they are open.
3. I live in San Francisco and am looking to find the addresses of public spaces with cafes and wifi so that I can see which ones are located near my office to go on my lunch break.
